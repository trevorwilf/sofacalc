Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) for predicting hospital mortality

note: This has been uploaded as a sample of my ShinyCode.  While this is functional, I do not pay for the services on shinyapps.io, so I cannot guarantee that it will be up when you need it.  My suggestion is to use another website such as clincalc.

The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) is used to track the a patients status while in the intensive care unit (ICU). The score is the conglomeration six different scores relating to: respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems.
Each system is given a rank of 0 - 4, 4 being the worse.  They are then tallied to make a comined score.<br/>
SOFA does not predict mortality, but does provide a mortality risk assessment. It was based on a study of 1449 patients from 40 intensive care units from around the world. The study followed patients over the age of 13 and who were in the ICU for longer than 48 hours.<br/>
SOFA is based on the following study:<br/>
